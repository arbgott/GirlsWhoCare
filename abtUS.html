My name is Kiara Montero Valdez.This is me aspiring cardiothoracic surgeon with a general interest in computer science. I was born in Puerto Rico and was raised there until I was 10 years old later in which my family and I moved to New York, and currently live in Brooklyn. My hobbies are playing video games, photography, art, and of course playing volleyball. <br>What I love about the healthcare system is that you can help in any sort of way. You can be a computer scientist, doctor, social worker, teacher, and still contribute to the builds up of the healthcare industry.
